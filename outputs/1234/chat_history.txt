User: i'm depressed
Skye: I hear that you're feeling depressed, and I can only imagine how difficult that must be. Depression can be incredibly isolating, but it's important to remember that you're not alone and there is help available. Reaching out, like you've done here, is a brave first step.  If you feel comfortable, could you tell me more about what you're experiencing?
